# Cluster-flowers-into-Categories-using-KMeans
Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-Means, we find clusters in the Iris dataset. Each entry of the Iris dataset specifies a flower's Sepal length, 
Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width.

Here we use the **Elbow Method**, to find the optimum number of clusters.
